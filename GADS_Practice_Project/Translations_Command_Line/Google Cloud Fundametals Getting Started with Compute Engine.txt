# Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## objectives :

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

    - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

    - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

    - Connect between the two instances.



## Steps :

1.  Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
        gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"--
subnet "default" --tags http

        gcloud compute firewall-rule create allow-http --action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS --rules=http:80 target-tags=http


2. Create a Compute Engine Virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
         gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
         gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --
subnet "default"




3. Connect between VM instances
   1. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm1 over the network:

      - connect to my-vm-2:

               gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

      - ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:

              ping -c 4 my-vm-1

      - Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:

             ssh my-vm-1

      - At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

            sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

      - Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

            sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

      - Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

            Hi from Ahmed

      - Exit the editor and confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

            curl http://localhost/

          - Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

      - To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

            exit

      - To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:

            curl http://my-vm-1/

           - Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.



   2. Now get the external IP from the my-vm-1 instance from this command:

          gcloud compute instances list --us-central-a


   3. Pastes the copied external IP address of my-vm-1 instance into a new browser tab and hit enter

           - Result: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
