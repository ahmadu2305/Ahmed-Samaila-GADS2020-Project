# Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives: 

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks: 
    
   - Initialize App Engine 
 
   - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell
  
   - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible     



## Steps: 

1. In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.

2. Click Continue and wait a few moments to provision and connect 

3. You can list the active account name with this command:

	 gcloud auth list 

	 	-Example Output: 
				Credentialed accounts: 
		 		    - google1623327-student@qwiklabs.net

4. You can list the project ID with this command:

	gcloud config list project 

		-Example Output: 
			[core]
			projects = qwiklabs-gcp-4476a13dea667a6

# Task 1: Initialize App 

1. Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

	gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

		-When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located. 

2. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
	
	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

3. Navigate to the source directory:
	
	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

## Task 2: Run Hello World application locally

1. Execute the following command to download and update the packages list:
	
	sudo apt-get update

2. Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system: 

	sudo apt-get install virtualenv

		-If prompted[Y/n],press Y and Enter
 
	virtualenv -p python3 venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
	
	source venv/bin/activate 

4. Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

	pip install  -r requirements.txt

5. Run the application: 

	python main.py 

		Please ignore the warning if any. 

6. In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application. 
	-To access the web preview icon, you may need to collapse the Navigation menu. 

		Example Output: 
			
			Hello World!

7. To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service

8. Using the Cloud Console, verify that the app is not deployed using this command: 
	
	gcloud app open-console

Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

1. Navigate to the source directory:

	cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Deploy your Hello World application using this command: 

	gcloud app deploy

			-If prompted "Do you want to conitue(Y/n), press Y and then Enter. 

3. Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

	gcloud app browse 

			Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window
	Results:

			URL : qwiklabs-gcp-04-5ebbcca718e5.appspot.com
			Hello World!

Congratulations! You created your first application using App Engine. 

Task 4: Disable the application, use this command:

1. List all versions of all services deployed to the App Engine server:
	
	gcloud app versions list

2. You can now disable the version of any services deployed to the App Engine server: 

	gcloud app versions stop --service=servicename v1 v2

This will stop both versions 1 and 2 

End your lab.
